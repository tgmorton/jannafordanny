1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,380
Another way you'll be asked to approach the erotic videos is through observatory attention,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,939
in which you bring non-judgmental awareness to both the scene and your own responses as they occur in the present moment.

3
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,319
This means noticing what you see,

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,000
hear,

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,739
and feel with openness and curiosity,

6
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:21,420
without trying to change or react to any of your responses.

7
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:23,459
First,

8
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:29,959
we will give you instructions and then guide you in a practice where you will apply this observatory approach while watching the erotic video.

9
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:31,819
During the actual experiment,

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,740
you will simply be reminded to use this approach before beginning,

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,360
so please give your full attention to these instructions now.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,819
As you watch the erotic video,

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,099
become an observer,

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,580
someone who watches and notices without becoming absorbed.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,459
Adopt the mindset of a neutral witness,

16
00:00:49,099 --> 00:01:01,180
like someone observing a scene from a distance and your own reactions as separate phenomena to take Simply witness what happens on the screen and in your body in the present moment as it actually occurs.

17
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:06,220
Become curious about your experience as if it is happening for the first time.

18
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:09,199
Notice what you see and hear in the video.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,760
Observe the movements,

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,620
interactions,

21
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,040
and expressions you see on screen.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,339
Take note of how the actors move,

23
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:18,019
how they interact sexually,

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,059
and what expressions they display.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,160
Attend to the visual and auditory elements of the scene as information comes into your awareness.

26
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:32,239
Let the details enter your awareness while keeping the perspective of a third-party observer.

27
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:35,160
As you watch the erotic video,

28
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:37,519
your internal experience may shift,

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,260
and your body may respond in various ways.

30
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:41,620
When this occurs,

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,480
turn your attention to notice these internal changes,

32
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:46,500
however slight they may be.

33
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:50,760
Notice any physical sensations such as changes in your breath,

34
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,199
any areas of tension,

35
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,220
warmth,

36
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:54,819
tingling,

37
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:55,379
pulsing,

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,300
or other bodily responses that may occur,

39
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,099
including in your genitals.

40
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:03,819
Notice how these sensations change moment by moment.

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,660
If you sense no sensations,

42
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,860
that's fine.

43
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,679
Just make note of whatever experience is there to be felt.

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,559
When you become aware of any sensation,

45
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,259
take note of it without trying to increase or decrease it.

46
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,440
Simply notice how your body responds to what you're watching.

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,000
Monitor the changes as they occur,

48
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:23,779
emerge,

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,220
and perhaps subside or strengthen.

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,460
Watch how sensations arise,

51
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,080
persist for a time,

52
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,339
and then fade away while maintaining your position as neutral observer.

53
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,860
As thoughts,

54
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:36,619
emotions,

55
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,679
or distractions come up,

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,979
recognize them as mental processes that are occurring,

57
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,300
temporary events in your mind.

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,039
You don't need to pursue these thoughts or push them away.

59
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,899
Simply observe that thinking is happening,

60
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,100
perhaps noting thinking to yourself,

61
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:58,100
and return your attention to watching both the video and your reactions to it.

62
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,839
If you notice yourself making judgments about your experience or trying to control what happens,

63
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:06,279
There is no need to judge your judging.

64
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:12,100
Simply observe that judging is occurring and return your attention back to your present moment experience.

65
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,580
Treat all mental activity as a mental inventory,

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,759
noticing,

67
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:17,860
letting go,

68
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,100
and then returning your attention back to the video and the moment-by-moment sensations.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,580
Continue observing your internal responses,

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,320
whatever they may be,

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,000
pleasant,

72
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,940
unpleasant,

73
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,100
or neutral.

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Simply notice what happens without needing to change or avoid it.

75
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,740
Notice the fluctuations in sensation without holding onto them or pushing them away.

76
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,759
Simply watch what occurs as it occurs,

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,960
maintaining your position as someone who monitors their own experience with detached attention.

78
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,520
Keep this watchful stance steady throughout the video.

79
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,199
Bring your full attention to what is happening right now,

80
00:03:56,339 --> 00:04:00,300
and keep returning to the present moment each time your focus drifts.

81
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,639
Observe the present moment experience as it happens,

82
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,979
without judgment,

83
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:06,179
interpreting it,

84
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,020
or becoming entangled with it.

85
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,300
Watch the patterns of response as they develop and fade.

86
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,679
Maintain this observatory stance throughout the entire video,

87
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,500
always returning your attention to the present whenever your awareness wanders.

88
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,899
In this way,

89
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,859
you are attending in an observatory fashion,

90
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,739
maintaining your perspective as a steady,

91
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,579
neutral observer who non-judgmentally tracks both external stimuli and internal responses as they occur,

92
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,019
moment by moment.

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,859
There is nothing to accomplish,

94
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,959
nothing to achieve or resist.

95
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,559
You are an observer,

96
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,579
studying it all with steady attention,

97
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,140
monitoring your bodily responses as information,

98
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,320
becoming curious and maintaining an observational distance from both external content and internal reactions.

99
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,459
Simply pay attention,

100
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,839
non-judgmentally,

101
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,040
to your experience as it unfolds,

102
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,220
moment by moment.
