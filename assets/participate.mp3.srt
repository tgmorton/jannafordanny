1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,819
The final way you will approach the videos is through participatory attention,

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:08,739
in which you allow yourself to become completely absorbed in the imagery and sounds,

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,079
as if they are a part of you.

4
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:15,180
This is akin to becoming immersed or entering a state of flow.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,040
First you will guide you through this as a practice,

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,239
and then you will apply this participatory approach while watching the erotic video.

7
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:24,079
During the actual experiment,

8
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:26,520
you will simply be reminded to use this approach,

9
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:29,680
so please give your full attention to these instructions now.

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,159
As you watch the video,

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,240
open yourself to fully experience the unfolding imagery and sounds.

12
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:38,819
Not as something happening to you,

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,060
but as something you are engaging with.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,459
Allow yourself to become immersed.

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,180
Let the imagery and sound draw you inward as a participant within the experience.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,740
Let go of the idea that you are watching a video.

17
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:53,819
Instead,

18
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:56,200
imagine you are inside it,

19
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:59,060
experiencing it with your whole being.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,680
as if what's happening on screen is unfolding with and through you.

21
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:08,800
Let go of evaluation and instead sink into the moment.

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,900
Let your attention be guided inward by the experience itself,

23
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:14,660
allowing each image,

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,459
sound,

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,519
and movement to meet you as you are.

26
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,739
Enter a shared rhythm with what you see and hear,

27
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,639
as if you and the video are part of the same living experience.

28
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,540
Tune into the texture of each moment fully in your body,

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,540
in the space where experience and awareness meet.

30
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,080
Allow yourself to become fully absorbed,

31
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,099
participating completely.

32
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,580
Notice how the scenes invite your body to respond.

33
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,680
Tune into those responses,

34
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,980
perhaps a shift in your breath,

35
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,559
a wave of warmth,

36
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,139
or a growing intensity.

37
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,879
You might feel tingling in your genitals,

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,379
pulses in your vulva,

39
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,639
or energy moving across your body.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,080
Stay with each sensation,

41
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,639
however small,

42
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,099
writing them as ocean waves.

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
There's no right way to feel.

44
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:09,300
Your only task is to stay present and allow what arises to carry you.

45
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,600
Let yourself be in dialogue with these sensations.

46
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,919
Follow the waves as they emerge,

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,160
intensify,

48
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,020
and dissolve.

49
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,119
This is not about controlling your experience,

50
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,759
but about being in relationship with it.

51
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:23,899
Allowing,

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,759
responding,

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,779
and writing it like a current.

54
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,460
There is nothing to fix or manage.

55
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,220
You are simply present,

56
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,600
letting the experience move through you.

57
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,419
Notice any sensations of arousal without judgment,

58
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,619
and allow them to emerge naturally.

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Just stay with it,

60
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,520
not directing or evaluating,

61
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,300
only connected to what is happening now.

62
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,380
You are an active participant in the moment.

63
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,300
Let the video draw you in and call forth responses already within you.

64
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,699
Become so deeply engaged,

65
00:02:59,139 --> 00:02:59,880
so absorbed,

66
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,259
that your awareness is carried by the rhythm of what's unfolding.

67
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,800
The more you engage this way,

68
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,919
the more you settle into that flow,

69
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,779
where you and the moment are not separate.

70
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,380
You're not pushing or trying.

71
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:14,979
You're allowing.

72
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:22,360
Let distractions fade and self-consciousness soften as your attention narrows into the unfolding experience.

73
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
This is merging.

74
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,460
Feel when you drop into that space and stay there.

75
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,779
Let your attention move fluidly between image,

76
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,820
sound,

77
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:33,759
and sensation,

78
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,600
noticing how one informs the other.

79
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:38,419
Like dancing with a partner,

80
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,419
you attune,

81
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:40,300
adjust,

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,100
and respond,

83
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
letting the interaction guide you.

84
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,199
The more you attune,

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,759
the more naturally your awareness will sync with the unfolding moment.

86
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,160
Stay with the moment-to-moment unfolding.

87
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,179
Let your awareness sharpen through the pull of the experience itself.

88
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,600
Let yourself become captivated.

89
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:03,179
Allow each new sensation to draw you deeper into the present,

90
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,139
as if nothing else exists beyond what's unfolding.

91
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,820
As your attention deepens,

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,839
let yourself merge with the flow of the moment.

93
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,479
Perhaps your sense of time shifts,

94
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:17,200
or your mind quiets as you become more immersed.

95
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:22,239
Let self-consciousness dissolve as you rest in embodied presence.

96
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,859
If thoughts arise,

97
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,519
gently return to the vivid immediacy of what you're experiencing.

98
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:29,339
This moment,

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,420
this pulse,

100
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,399
this wave,

101
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,839
this scene.

102
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:36,839
Let yourself become so absorbed that the world around you fades,

103
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:40,839
and your attention becomes fully focused on what you feel now.

104
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,839
The more you engage in this relational way,

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,640
the more you settle into flow,

106
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,040
where you and the unfolding moment are not separate,

107
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:52,239
and each sensation draws you deeper into presence.

108
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,279
You don't need to get it right.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,420
Stay with each wave of sensation,

110
00:04:57,299 --> 00:05:01,600
allowing yourself to be fully immersed until you are at one with the unfolding moment,

111
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:02,799
fully absorbed,

112
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,059
fully attuned,

113
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,660
fully present.
