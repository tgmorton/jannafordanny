1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,059
One approach you will use to watch the video is just the way you naturally do.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,039
That is,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,739
just watch the video as you normally would,

4
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:10,060
as if you were at home.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,300
First we will give you instructions on what to do here,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,899
and then guide you in a practice in which you will apply neutral attention while watching the erotic video.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,840
During the actual experiment,

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:24,479
you will simply be reminded to use this natural approach before beginning,

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,020
so please give your full attention to these instructions now.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,500
The videos you will watch contain sexually explicit content.

11
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,040
The sexual activities displayed may vary.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,299
The gender of the actors may also vary.

13
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:44,580
This part of the study is designed to observe how people naturally view sexually explicit films as if they were at home.

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,240
While the video is playing,

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,840
just watch it as you naturally would as if you were at home.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,299
You'll be asked a series of questions after each video.

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,740
You are in a private room.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,819
No one can see or hear you.

19
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,200
There are no cameras or live monitors.

20
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,900
Your experience is your own.

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,260
This setup is meant to help you focus on the video without distractions or concern for how you might appear.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,300
We've tried to make your setting as private and comfortable as possible,

23
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:20,459
so get in a comfortable position on the couch and settle into the room so you can watch the videos as if you were at home.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,800
After these instructions are over,

25
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,739
you can let us know if there are any adjustments we can make to increase your comfort.

26
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,900
For certain parts of the study,

27
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:31,400
you will be instructed to let your attention be natural,

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,959
as if you were at home.

29
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:33,900
That is,

30
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:38,300
you are meant to watch the video as you naturally would outside of a research setting.

31
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,959
You may find that your thoughts drift or that you become aware of sensations in your body.

32
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,279
When you notice this,

33
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,680
watch the video in whatever way feels most normal to you.

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,800
It is possible that while watching,

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,199
you may notice signs of sexual arousal or other bodily reactions.

36
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:58,379
Your attention and reactions should be whatever they would be as if you were at home.

37
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,019
You do not need to do anything specific with your thoughts,

38
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:02,800
emotions,

39
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:03,940
or sensations.

40
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,580
Just keep your focus on the sexually explicit film as you typically would.

41
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,740
If your breathing changes or your heart rate increases,

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
just keep watching the video.

43
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:21,839
The idea is to bring the same attitude to this video as if you were enjoying a sexually explicit film in your everyday life.

44
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:23,080
That said,

45
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,580
you should remain seated and avoid any self-stimulation during the erotic video.

46
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,940
Practicing in this way should feel familiar to you.

47
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,800
You are viewing the video just as you would watch it,

48
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:35,240
as if you were in your own space,

49
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,259
comfortable and usual.

50
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:41,820
You are not trying to think in a certain way or avoid specific reactions.

51
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,220
Just watch,

52
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:47,380
viewing the video as you naturally would outside of a research setting.

53
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:52,440
If at any point during the session you feel uncomfortable or wish to stop the study,

54
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,979
you are free to do so.

55
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,779
Use the communication device provided to let the research assistant know.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,940
Someone will respond promptly.

57
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:01,500
Now,

58
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,059
take a moment to sit comfortably.

59
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:06,080
There is no specific posture you need to hold.

60
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,660
Just sit in any way that feels natural.

61
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,759
Rest your hands on your lap or by your sides.

62
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,520
Let your shoulders relax.

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:14,979
Take a slow,

64
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:19,419
deep breath and allow yourself to settle into the couch and get comfortable.

65
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:21,259
As the video plays,

66
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,199
notice what you see and hear as if you are watching a sexually explicit video at home.

67
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,039
If your mind wanders,

68
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:28,779
that's fine.

69
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,800
If you notice physical sensations,

70
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,839
that's normal.

71
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,759
If you feel nothing in particular,

72
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,080
that's okay too.

73
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,220
You do not need to create any specific experience,

74
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:43,259
just watch the video as you normally would as if in the comfort of your own home.

75
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,360
You will get a reminder to use this same neutral approach before the actual video starts.

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,500
For now,

77
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,199
use this practice period to become comfortable with watching the erotic video.

78
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,759
We'll now move into a short practice period so you can get a sense of what it feels like to watch naturally in this environment.

79
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,639
This is to help you become familiar with the experience before the study begins.
