1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,640
The way you will approach the videos is through participatory attention, in which you allow yourself to become completely absorbed in the imagery and sounds, as if they are a part of you.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,479
This is akin to becoming immersed or entering a state of flow.

3
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:22,079
First, you will guide you through this as a practice, and then you will apply this participatory approach while watching the erotic video.

4
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:29,219
During the actual experiment, you will simply be reminded to use this approach, so please give your full attention to these instructions now.

5
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:40,560
As you watch the video, open yourself to fully experience the unfolding imagery and sounds, not as something happening to you, but as something you are engaging with.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,380
Allow yourself to become immersed.

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,020
Let the imagery and sound draw you inward, as a participant within the experience.

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,380
Let go of the idea that you are watching a video.

9
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,419
Instead, imagine you are inside it, experiencing it.

10
00:00:57,419 --> 00:01:03,119
with your whole being, as if what's happening on screen is unfolding with and through you.

11
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,279
Let go of evaluation and instead sink into the moment.

12
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:12,720
Let your attention be guided inward by the experience itself.

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:24,660
allowing each image, sound, and movement to meet you as you are, enter a shared rhythm with what you see and hear, as if you and the video are part of the same living experience.

14
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:32,459
Tune into the texture of each moment, fully in your body, in the space where experience and awareness meet.

15
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,839
Allow yourself to become fully absorbed, participating completely.

16
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:41,160
Notice how the scenes invite your body to respond.

17
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,559
Tune into those responses.

18
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:49,019
Perhaps the shift in your breath, a wave of warmth, or a growing intensity.

19
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:55,319
You might feel tingling in your genitals, pulses in your vulva, or energy moving across your body.

20
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,860
Stay with each sensation, however small, writing them as ocean waves.

21
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,440
There's no right way to feel.

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,759
Your only task is to stay present and allow what arises to carry you.

23
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,600
Let yourself be in dialogue with these sensations.

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,739
Follow the waves as they emerge, intensify and dissolve.

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:26,460
This is not about controlling your experience, but about being in relationship with it, allowing, responding, and writing it like a current.

26
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,880
There is nothing to fix or manage.

27
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,059
You are simply present, letting the experience move through you.

28
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:39,419
Notice any sensations of arousal without judgment, and allow them to emerge naturally.

29
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:46,739
Just stay with it, not directing or evaluating, only connected to what is happening now.

30
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,940
You are an active participant in the moment.

31
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,740
Let the video draw you in and call forth responses already within you.

32
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:03,179
Become so deeply engaged, so absorbed that your awareness is carried by the rhythm of what's unfolding.

33
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:07,500
The more you engage this way, the more you settle into that flow.

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,440
Where you and the moment are not separate.

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,880
You're not pushing or trying, you're allowing.

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:22,320
Let distractions fade and self-consciousness soften, as your attention narrows into the unfolding experience.

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,359
This is merging.

38
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,020
Feel when you drop into that space and stay there.

39
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:43,080
Let your attention move fluidly between image, sound, and sensation, noticing how one informs the other, like dancing with a partner, you would tune, adjust, and respond, letting the interaction guide you.

40
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,360
The more you attune, the more naturally your awareness will sink with the unfolding moment.

41
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,000
Stay with the moment to moment unfolding.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,839
Let your awareness sharpen through the pull of the experience itself.

43
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:58,320
Let yourself become captivated.

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:06,179
Allow each new sensation, to draw you deeper into the present, as if nothing else exists beyond what's unfolding.

45
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,639
As your attention deepens.

46
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,339
Let yourself merge with the flow of the moment.

47
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:17,100
Perhaps your sense of time shifts, or your mind quiets as you become more immersed.

48
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,959
Let self consciousness dissolve as you rest in embodied presence.

49
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,359
If thoughts arise, gently return to the vivid immediacy of what you're experiencing.

50
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:40,559
This moment, this pulse, this wave, this scene. Let yourself become so absorbed that the world around you fades, and your attention becomes fully focused on what you feel now.

51
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:52,079
The more you engage in this relational way, the more you settle into flow, where you and the unfolding moment are not separate, and each sensation draws you deeper into presence.

52
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,760
You don't need to get it right.

53
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:05,159
Stay with each wave of sensation, allowing yourself to be fully immersed until you are at one with the unfolding moment, fully absorbed, fully attuned, fully present.
