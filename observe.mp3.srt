1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,560
approach the erotic videos is through observatory attention, in which you bring non-judgmental awareness to both the scene and your own responses as they occur in the present moment.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:20,159
This means noticing what you see, hear, and feel, with openness and curiosity, without trying to change or react to any of your responses.

3
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:28,500
First, we will give you instructions and then guide you in a practice where you will apply this observatory approach while watching the erotic video.

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,240
During the actual experiment, you will simply be reminded to use this approach before beginning.

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,720
So please give your full attention to these instructions now.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:44,220
As you watch the erotic video, become an observer, someone who watches and notices without becoming absorbed.

7
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:52,919
Adopt the mindset of a neutral witness, like someone observing a scene from a distance and your own reactions as separate phenomena to take in.

8
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:59,880
Simply witness what happens on the screen and in your body in the present moment, as it actually occurs.

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,440
Become curious about your experience as if it is happening for the 1st time.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,739
Notice what you see and hear in the video.

11
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,599
Observe the movements, interactions and expressions you see on screen.

12
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:18,479
Take note of how the actors move, how they interact sexually, and what expressions they display.

13
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,959
Attend to the visual and auditory elements of the scene, as information comes into your awareness.

14
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,660
Let the details enter your awareness.

15
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,839
while keeping the perspective of a 3rd party observer.

16
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:38,879
As you watch the erotic video, your internal experience may shift, and your body may respond in various ways.

17
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:45,059
When this occurs, turn your attention to notice these internal changes, however slight they may be.

18
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:59,099
Notice any physical sensations, such as changes in your breath, any areas of tension, warmth, tingling, pulsing, or other bodily responses that may occur, including in your genitals.

19
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,339
Notice how these sensations change moment by moment.

20
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:05,400
If you sense no sensations, that's fine.

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,059
Just make note of whatever experience is there to be felt.

22
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:15,660
When you become aware of any sensation, take note of it without trying to increase or decrease it.

23
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,839
Simply notice how your body responds to what you're watching.

24
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:24,779
Monitor the changes as they occur, emerge, and perhaps subside or strengthen.

25
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:33,000
Watch how sensations arise, persist for a time, and then fade away, while maintaining your position as neutral observer.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,660
As thoughts, emotions, or distractions come up, recognize them as mental processes that are occurring, temporary events in your mind.

27
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,440
You don't need to pursue these thoughts or push them away.

28
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:56,520
Simply observe that thinking is happening, perhaps noting, thinking to yourself, and return your attention to watching both the video and your reactions to it.

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:04,860
If you notice yourself making judgments about your experience or trying to control what happens, there is no need to judge your judging.

30
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,800
Simply observe that judging is occurring.

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
And return your attention back to your present moment experience.

32
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:20,880
Treat all mental activity as a mental inventory, noticing, letting go, and then returning your attention back to the video, and the moment by moment sensations.

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:28,679
Continue observing your internal responses, whatever they may be, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.

34
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:32,639
Simply notice what happens without needing to change or avoid it.

35
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,160
Notice the fluctuations and sensation without holding onto them or pushing them away.

36
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:46,800
Simply watch what occurs as it occurs, maintaining your position as someone who monitors their own experience with detached attention.

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,919
Keep this watchful stance steady throughout the video.

38
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:58,919
Bring your full attention to what is happening right now, and keep returning to the present moment each time your focus drifts.

39
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:06,419
Observe the present moment experience as it happens without judgment, interpreting it, or becoming entangled with it.

40
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,959
Watch the patterns of response as they develop and fade.

41
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:18,059
Maintain this observatory stance throughout the entire video, always returning your attention to the present, whenever your awareness wanders.

42
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:33,420
In this way, you are attending in an observatory fashion, maintaining your perspective as a steady, neutral observer, who non-judgmentally tracks both external stimuli and internal responses as they occur moment by moment.

43
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,500
There is nothing to accomplish, nothing to achieve or resist.

44
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:52,200
You are an observer, studying at all with steady attention, monitoring your bodily responses as information, becoming curious, and maintaining an observational distance from both external content and internal reactions.

45
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,619
Simply pay attention, non-judgmentally, to your experience as it unfolds moment by moment.
