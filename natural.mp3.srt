1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,340
One approach you will use to watch the video is just the way you naturally do.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,319
That is, just watch the video as you normally would, as if you were at home.

3
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:27,899
First, you will give you instructions on what to do here, and then guide you into practice in which you will apply neutral attention while watching the erotic video. During the actual experiment, you will simply be reminded to use this natural approach before beginning, so please give your full attention to these instructions now.

4
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:35,220
The videos you will watch contains sexually explicit content, the sexual activities displayed may vary.

5
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,259
The gender of the actors may also vary.

6
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:44,580
This part of the study is designed to observe how people naturally view sexually explicit films as if they were at home.

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,040
While the video is playing, just watch it as you naturally would, as if you were at home.

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,279
You'll be asked a series of questions after each video.

9
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:55,680
You are in a private room.

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,900
No one can see or hear you.

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,479
There are no cameras or live monitors.

12
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,759
Your experience is your own.

13
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:09,419
This setup is meant to help you focus on the video without distractions or concern for how you might appear.

14
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:13,319
We've tried to make your setting as private and comfortable as possible.

15
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:20,519
So get in a comfortable position on the couch and settle into the room so you can watch the videos as if you were at home.

16
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,699
After these instructions are over, you can let us know if there are any adjustments we can make to increase your comfort.

17
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:33,059
For certain parts of the study, you will be instructed to let your attention be natural, as if you were at home.

18
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:38,220
That is, you are meant to watch the video as you naturally would outside of a research setting.

19
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,800
You may find that your thoughts drift or that you become aware of sensations in your body.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,759
When you notice this, watch the video in whatever way feels most normal to you.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,459
It is possible that while watching, you may notice signs of sexual arousal or other bodily reactions.

22
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,259
Your attention and reactions should be whatever they would be as if you were at home.

23
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,260
You do not need to do anything specific with your thoughts, motions, or sensations.

24
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,520
Just keep your focus on the sexually explicit film as you typically would.

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,800
If your breathing changes or your heart rate increases, just keep watching the video.

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:27,600
The idea is to bring the same attitude to this video as if you were enjoying a sexually explicit film in your everyday life. That said, you should remain seated and avoid any self-stimulation during the erotic video.

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,839
Practicing in this way should feel familiar to you.

28
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:42,059
You are viewing the video just as you would watch it as if you were in your own space, comfortable and usual. You are not trying to think in a certain way, or avoid specific reactions.

29
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:47,220
Just watch, viewing the video as you naturally would outside of a research setting.

30
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,940
If at any point during this session, you feel uncomfortable or wish to stop the study, you are free to do so.

31
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,059
Use the communication device provided to let the research assistant know, someone will respond promptly.

32
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:03,300
Now, take a moment to sit comfortably.

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,059
There is no specific posture you need to hold.

34
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,699
Just sit in any way that feels natural.

35
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:11,940
Rest your hands on your lap or by your sides.

36
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,740
Let your shoulders relax.

37
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:19,800
Take a slow, deep breath and allow yourself to settle into the couch and get comfortable.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,160
As the video plays, notice what you see and hear, as if you were watching a sexually explicit video at home.

39
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,799
If your mind wanders, that's fine.

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,919
If you notice physical sensations, that's normal.

41
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,220
If you feel nothing in particular, that's okay too.

42
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,399
You do not need to create any specific experience.

43
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:43,139
Just watch the video as you normally would as if in the comfort of your own home.

44
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,419
You will get a reminder to use the same neutral approach before the actual video starts.

45
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,279
For now, use this practice period to become comfortable with watching the erotic video.

46
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:59,940
We'll now move into a short practice period so you can get a sense of what it feels like to watch naturally in this environment.

47
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,679
This is to help you become familiar with the experience before this study begins.
